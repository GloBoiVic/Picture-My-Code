Inspired by Ray.so's code sharing app. This app boasts some additional features for devs to share code snippets.

## Features

- Using Zustand's persist state api, customizations are stored in local storage for quick code captures.
- Dark and light mode themes.
- Over 12 font styles, including popular monospace fonts.
- Supports most major languages with automatic code detection and syntax highlighting.
- Export with multiple export options: save as SVG/PNG, copy to clipboard, and copy as a link.
- Additional customizations for your needs.

## Technologies used

- [React](https://es.reactjs.org/) - Front-End JavaScript library.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework.
- [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com) - Re-usable components built using Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) - Bear necessities for state management in React.
- [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) - Syntax highlighter.
- [React Simple Code Editor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-simple-code-editor) - Browser based code editor.
- [HTML to Image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-image) - Generates an image from a DOM node using HTML5 canvas and SVG.

## Limitations

- Due to the nature of the project, this app is not mobile responsive.
- Code editor does not autocomplete or auto line break. Thus beware of pasting code lines longer than 80 characters or trying to write code manually. Will look into other alternatives than the react simple code editor (Monaco Editor).

## Future Features

- Editor responsiveness: Autocomplete, Auto line break
- Mobile responsiveness
